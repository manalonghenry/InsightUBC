# CPSC 310 Project Repository

Our project is designed to display dataset analysis by leveraging the EBNF language to query the data. Given our Sections Insight frontend, the user can upload a dataset stored within a zip folder and name the dataset. The user can then input their desired information to query the dataset and display the information via a visualization. 

## Configuring your environment

To start using this project, you need to get your development environment configured so that you can build and execute the code.
To do this, follow these steps; the specifics of each step will vary based on your operating system:

1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (v2.X). You should be able to execute `git --version` on the command line after installation is complete.

1. [Install Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS: v18.X), which will also install NPM (you should be able to execute `node --version` and `npm --version` on the command line).

1. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (1.22.X). You should be able to execute `yarn --version`.

1. Clone your repository by running `git clone REPO_URL` from the command line. You can get the REPO_URL by clicking on the green button on your project repository page on GitHub. Note that due to new department changes you can no longer access private git resources using https and a username and password. You will need to use either [an access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) or [SSH](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

1. Run `yarn start` to start the server, and then cd into the frontend folder and run `yarn start` again to run the frontend.

1. Go to `localhost:3000` in a browser to see and interact with the frontend.

## Project commands

Once your environment is configured you need to further prepare the project's tooling and dependencies.
In the project folder:

1. `yarn install` to download the packages specified in your project's *package.json* to the *node_modules* directory.

1. `yarn build` to compile your project. You must run this command after making changes to your TypeScript files. If it does not build locally, AutoTest will not be able to build it.

1. `yarn test` to run the test suite.
    - To run with coverage, run `yarn cover`

1. `yarn lint` to lint your project code. If it does not lint locally, AutoTest will not run your tests when you submit your code.

1. `yarn pretty` to prettify your project code.

If you are curious, some of these commands are actually shortcuts defined in [package.json -> scripts](./package.json).

## Running and testing from an IDE

IntelliJ Ultimate should be automatically configured the first time you open the project (IntelliJ Ultimate is a free download through the [JetBrains student program](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students/)).

### Important Notes

Unfortunately, there are bugs in our code. Additionally, our frontend is not fully functional.
